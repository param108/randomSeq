# Random Sequence generator

A simple Repeating Random Sequence generator which will generate a repeating string of ones and zeroes.

# Challenge
1. Correctly identify the repeating string.
1. To test your code build this project using
`make build`
1. To run the code 
`./randomSeq <number of bits you want of the sequence>`
1. The correct string should be identifiable by inspection

## Caveats
The code guarantees that there will be atleast one repeating string and does not place guarantees on its length.
